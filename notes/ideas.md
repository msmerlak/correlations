## Questions

We wish to estimate the correlation matrix $C$ of high-dimensional, possibly heavy-tailed data. While a large literature has explored the optimal estimation of the eigenvalues of $C$ (theory of rotationally invariant estimators), the accurate estimation of the eigenvectors of $C$ has remained relatively unexplored.   

1. How reliable are Pearson eigenvectors? Not very (not at all?) if tails are heavy. 
2. Can we improve estimation of eigenvectors using robust correlations (Spearman, Kendall)? 
3. What if the data is not elliptically distributed?   

## Setup

1. Synthetic data: multivariate Student with fixed correlation matrix and tunable $\nu$.
2. Financial data:
